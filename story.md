User Story:
Why am I going to this app?
As a user I want to use the tools to play table top RPG games without having to carry die around and referencing the rule book constantly. I want a place to role and store my attacks.

Character stats:
As a player I want to store and be able to reference my general character info at the start of the game and as I level up.

Choose attack:
As a player I want to be able to select which attacks I want to use based on the one's I have built.

Roll:
As a player I want to be able to roll for my action or attack based on the dice I have specified when I built my attacks. I also want to see the result of the roll.

Build Attack:
As a player I want to build all of the attacks I am going to use in the game by specifying name of the attack, the dice type I want to use, the number of dice I want to use, and my array of base stats.

I then want to be able to store these attacks so I can reference them, use them, and see the attacks I have already built.
