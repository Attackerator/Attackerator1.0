TableTop Attack builder!

Contributers - Jason Logan, Mitchell Brock, David Becker

This product is designed to hit the pain points of new table top RPG players. The player should be able to build and store several different weapon and spell attacks that take in the necessary parameters for accurate damage results. The app will handle the physical dice rolling for initiative, hit calculation, and damage calculation saving the player time spent on reference and manual calculations.
